> #### <center> *Seamless Camera Equipment Tracking System*

The aim of this application is that it serves as a tool for users to keep track of their photography equipment that they
intend to purchase. It allows users to input and manage details of the gear they are interested in, such as brand,
price, model number, and shop name. Additionally, users can select categories from a predefined list to categorize their
desired items.

The application will primarily be used :

- **Photography enthusiasts and professionals who want to keep a comprehensive record of their photography gear.**
- **Individuals who are interested in purchasing photography equipment.**
- **Users who enjoy organizing and managing their equipment information efficiently.**
- **People who frequently research and compare various equipment options before making buying decisions.**

As a photography enthusiast, I understand the excitement and sometimes overwhelming process of researching and choosing
photography equipment. It allows me to combine my technical skills with my personal interests, creating a useful tool
for users in creating a comprehensive wishlist that they can refer to when making purchasing decisions.
